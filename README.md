This repo lists all the big games coded by me so far
## 1. US States Learning Game:
<img src=""></img>
This python game lets you guess 50 american states and also helps you learn them by visually depeciting the USA map.
  1. After guessing the correct state, the name will appear on the correct location of the U.S map
  2. If you can't figure out all the states then exit the game and new ``missing_states`` file will be created inside ``savefiles`` folder through which you can know which states      you actually mixed and learn them again.
